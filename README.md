Maps generates random maps using JS/canvas. This was a quick exercise in figuring out how to use canvas. I may extend it later if I get bored.

The algorithm is described [here](http://properundead.com/2009/03/cave-generator.html).

A copy is hosted [here](http://basicio.com/cs/maps/) if you just want to see what it does.
